Files in this directory:

README     : This file.
server.cer : The server x.509 certificate used for SSL connections.
cert.pem   : The client x.509 certificate used for mutual SSL authentication.
key.pem    : The private key for cert.pem.

Spring Boot is configured to use/trust the certificates in this directory when run in a local, non-container context.
You will need these files to test HTTPS requests using Postman or other REST client. The CN for cert.pem is
vaadevmessaging.orionhealthcloud.com. A user with this name will need to be set up in the JDBC store to perform mutual
authentication (one is already set up in the in-memory database configuration).

The passcode for all keystores and keys is: abc123
